### This is the original repository for the BetweenNet paper


**Installing the dependencies**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## **Betweenness**

### **Input**

1. The PPI network file:

The file is located at data/InfluenceMatrix

```
gene1 gene2 confidence value
MDM2  TP53  0.99
APP APP 0.99
MYC MAX 0.98
...
```
2. Patients data (Normal and Tumor):

Files are located at data/Betweenness
```
gene_id        TCGA-A7-A0CE-01A    gene_id        TCGA-A7-A0CE-11A

```
Note: "removed"  refers to a gene is not expressed or is a mutated gene

### **Run Betweenness calculation**
```
cd src
./betweenness ./data/Betweenness
```

### **Output**
Files will be located at out/Betweenness
Sample: TCGA-22-5478-01.txt
```
Gene         Betweenness value

```

## **Generate input for Random walk**

### **Input**
1. Mutation matrix
The file contains a matrix of mutated genes.
The file is located at data/MutationMatrix.csv

```
Genes   g1  g2  g3  g4 ... gn
p1      1   0   0   1  ... 1
p2      0   1   1   0  ... 1
p3      1   1   1   0  ... 0
p4      1   0   0   1  ... 1
....
```
2. Outliers matrix
The file contains a matrix of outlier genes.
The file is located at data/OutliersMatrix.csv

```
Genes   g1      g2      g3     ...  gn
p1      True    True    False  ...  True
p2      True    False   False  ...  False
p3      False   True    False  ...  False
p4      True    False   True   ...  True
....
```

### **Outliers matrix generation**
To generate the outliers matrix, run  generate_outliers.py script, as follow:

```
python generate_outliers.py [Input directory] [Betweenness Results Path] [Genes list]
```
### **Output**


## **Random Walk**
### **Input**

1 - The nodes to index file mapping:
The file is located at out/BRCA_index.txt
```
index GeneName
1 A1BG
2 A1CF
```
2 - Edge file:
The file is located at out/BRCA_edges.txt
```
node_i_Index node_j_Index weight
0 1 1
0 2 1
```
3 - The gene and its corresponding mutation frequency:
This file contains the mutation frequncies, which are assigned as heats during the random walk.
